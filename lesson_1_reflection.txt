How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    When there is some modification and it causes the bug 
    then we can find where we made the change and figure it out easily

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The programmer can follow whole the flow of the work and 
    it will make programmer to think more about 
    how to program better

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros to create commit manually : 
    the programmer can commit and control the project history on his own purpose. more efficient, and neat. 
    cons to manual commit creation :
    it is easy to forget / if there is no agreement on when to commit and there are many people sharing the project, the repository can be messy

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I don't know. i have no idea about that... 
    maybe, cause it is inefficient?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    we can tract what happened by following all history 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it is possible undo the changes which was wrong edit, or mistake causing critical problems

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    that's why i am taking this course :-P
